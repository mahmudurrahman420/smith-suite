# Updates and privacy

Solidsmith tells you when a newer release is out. It never updates itself without asking, and
the check sends nothing about you or your designs.

## What you see

When a newer stable release exists, a small accent-coloured pill reading **Update to 0.14.0**
(the new version) appears in the title bar next to **Report a bug**. Nothing pops up by itself:
clicking the pill opens a small window with the new version, its release notes and three
choices. In a narrower window the pill shortens to **Update** so the document tabs keep their
room, then to its icon alone.

- **Download** opens the file that fits your installation (see the table below) in your
  browser, or the release page when there isn't one.
- **Skip this version** hides the pill until an even newer release comes out.
- **Remind me later** hides it for three days.

Solidsmith checks every time it starts, so a release that came out since you last opened it shows
up straight away, and again once a day while it stays open.

**Preferences ▸ General ▸ Updates** has **Check for updates automatically** (on by default) and
**Check now**, which checks right away and shows the window even for a version you skipped.

**Help ▸ Check for updates** runs the same check, including from the macOS menu bar. The window
shows progress, offers the installation or download when a newer version exists, or says
**Solidsmith is up to date.** If the check fails, it shows the error instead. Manual checks work
even when automatic checks are turned off; builds that cannot check explain that in the window.

## Updating in one click

Where Solidsmith can replace itself safely, the window also has **Update now**:

| Installed as | Update now does |
|---|---|
| AppImage | Downloads the new AppImage next to the old one, verifies it, renames it over the old file and offers **Restart now**; a file named like a release (`solidsmith-<version>-linux-<arch>.AppImage`) takes the new release's name, so tools such as Gearlever keep finding its update data, and any other name is kept |
| Windows installer (`.msi`) | **Install (closes Solidsmith)**: downloads and verifies the `.msi`, closes Solidsmith (asking about unsaved designs first) and starts the installer |
| Windows portable `.zip` or `.exe` | Downloads and verifies the package, swaps in the new `solidsmith.exe` (and `solidsmith-cli.exe`) and offers **Restart now**; the old file is removed at the next start |
| macOS | **Download and open**: downloads and verifies the `.dmg` and opens it; quit Solidsmith, then drag the new Solidsmith to Applications to replace the old copy (macOS won't replace an app that is running) |
| Flatpak, Snap, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.tar.gz` | Nothing: your package manager updates these (the window shows the command), or you unpack the new archive |

Every download is verified before anything changes: its SHA-256 must match the release's
`SHA256SUMS.txt`, fetched over HTTPS from the same release, and, once the project signs its
releases, that list must carry a valid signature by Solidsmith's release key that names the
release (see [releasing](https://github.com/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith/blob/main/docs/releasing.md#update-signing)).
A download that doesn't verify is deleted and the installed copy is left as it was; **Download**
still gets the package for a manual install. On macOS Solidsmith opens the disk image rather than
replacing the app itself: you drag the new app to Applications, as you did the first time. The
app and the disk image are signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so macOS opens the
new copy without a warning.

Update now needs write access to the installed file: an AppImage in a folder you can't write to
fails with a message, and **Download** is the way to update it.

## Updating from 0.11 to 0.14

Solidsmith 0.11.0 to 0.14.0 only accept packages from the project's old GitHub address. Since
the repository moved to `github.com/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith`, every release names the new address,
so these versions see that a newer release is out but find no package in it: **Update now** can't
install it, and **Download** opens the release page.

Download 0.15.0 or later once yourself, from the release page or the
[download links](https://github.com/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith#download), and install it over the old
version as you first installed it. From 0.15.0 on, Solidsmith accepts either address, and
**Update now** works again. Package managers (Flatpak, Snap, WinGet, `.deb`, `.rpm`) aren't
affected.

## What is sent

One HTTPS request each time Solidsmith starts, and once a day while it stays open:

```text
GET https://api.github.com/repos/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith/releases/latest
User-Agent: Solidsmith-update-check
Accept: application/vnd.github+json
X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28
```

**Update now** then downloads `SHA256SUMS.txt` (and its signature) and the one package from the
release's own `github.com/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith/releases/download/…` links, with the same
User-Agent. That's all: no version number, no machine or user identifier, no usage data, no cookies. GitHub
sees the request like any other visit to the API (your IP address, the time); see
[GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
Solidsmith compares the answer with its own version on your computer.

- Offline, or GitHub doesn't answer within 15 seconds: nothing is shown, and the check is tried
  again an hour later (or at the next start, whichever comes first).
- GitHub's rate limit for anonymous requests (60 an hour per address) is respected: when GitHub
  says to wait, Solidsmith waits that long, Check now and the check at start included.
- Turning off **Check for updates automatically** stops the checks; only **Check now** asks.
- Setting the environment variable `SOLIDSMITH_UPDATE_CHECK=0` turns all checks off, for
  example on managed machines.

Builds you compile yourself, the Flatpak and the browser app never check, and Preferences shows
no check controls for them. The browser app updates itself: reload the page to get the latest
version. When the network is unavailable, or the update can't finish downloading in time, the
saved version opens instead, and the download continues for the next reload.

## Managed by a launcher

When a launcher such as the Smith Suite Launcher installed Solidsmith, it also updates it. Solidsmith
notices this in two ways:

- the environment variable `SOLIDSMITH_MANAGED_BY` is set; its value is the launcher's name, for
  example `Smith Suite Launcher`, and
- the Smith Suite Launcher's `installed.json` (in its per-user data folder, read-only) lists this
  Solidsmith: its recorded path is this executable, this AppImage or `.app`, or the folder this
  executable was unpacked into.

Solidsmith then still checks for a newer release, and the pill and **Check now** work as before, but
the window says **Update available: update Solidsmith in Smith Suite Launcher** and offers only
**Skip this version** and **Remind me later**. There is no **Update now**, **Download** or
AppImage replacement, so the launcher's record of what is installed stays right. Without the
variable or a record, nothing changes. Setting `SOLIDSMITH_UPDATE_CHECK=0` still turns the checks
off.

## Which file Download gets

Releases attach the main packages under fixed names (see [releasing](https://github.com/mahmudurrahman420/solidsmith/blob/main/docs/releasing.md)),
and Solidsmith picks the one matching how it was installed:

| Installed as | Detected by | Download | How to update |
|---|---|---|---|
| AppImage | `APPIMAGE` is set | `solidsmith-linux-<arch>.AppImage` | Replace the old AppImage with the new one |
| Flatpak | `FLATPAK_ID` is set | doesn't check (see below) | `flatpak update io.tangencylabs.solidsmith` |
| Snap from the Snap Store | `SNAP` is set | release page | `sudo snap refresh solidsmith` (snapd also refreshes by itself) |
| Snap from a downloaded file | `SNAP_REVISION` starts with `x` | `solidsmith-linux-<arch>.snap` | `sudo snap install --dangerous ./solidsmith-linux-<arch>.snap` |
| `.deb` | under `/usr`, dpkg knows `solidsmith` | `solidsmith-linux-<arch>.deb` | `sudo apt install ./solidsmith-linux-<arch>.deb` |
| `.rpm` | under `/usr`, an rpm database exists | `solidsmith-linux-<arch>.rpm` | `sudo dnf install ./solidsmith-linux-<arch>.rpm` |
| `.tar.gz` | anywhere else on Linux | `solidsmith-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz` | Unpack over the old copy |
| Windows installer | under Program Files, or in the folder the installer recorded | `solidsmith-windows-<arch>.msi` | Run the installer |
| Windows portable | `solidsmith-cli.exe` beside it | `solidsmith-windows-<arch>-portable.zip` | Unzip over the old copy |
| Windows `.exe` | anywhere else on Windows | `Solidsmith-<version>-windows-x64.exe` | Replace the old `.exe` |
| macOS | inside `Solidsmith.app` | `solidsmith-macos-universal.dmg` | Quit Solidsmith, then drag the new app to Applications |

The window shows the command for Snap, `.deb` and `.rpm` installations, with a Copy button. The
Flatpak has no network permission and Flatpak itself (or your software center) offers its
updates, so it never checks. Release builds compare versions as [semver](https://semver.org): a nightly build counts
as the release it was built after, so it's offered only a newer stable release, and release
candidates are offered their final release.
